Delay in approvals and tracking the labour working hours at the facility was time consuming and cumbersome. Things got complicated when there was raise in material request which was not in the stock. Without a proper communication customer retention was also at stake. All together it lead to the revenue leakage. The challenging factor was to introduce an automated standard operating procedure without affecting the existing working environment. Simplifying and inculcating an intelligent application in the firm was also stimulating."
